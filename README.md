# Vendor-Agnostic RAN Optimization Using Generative AI 



# Details

* Problem Statement

Modern multi-vendor RANs generate complex, dynamic/inconsistent data that makes manual optimization time-consuming and error-prone. Traditional rule-based solutions can't adapt to changing network conditions or vendor diversity. There's a need for a sophisticated, vendor-agnostic solution that can reason on KPIs, identify anomalies, and autonomously suggest optimizations.  This project proposes a Generative AI–driven reasoning framework that learns from real telemetry to deliver explainable, adaptive RAN performance improvements.

*  What interesting technology did we use?

1. Generative AI / LLMs
Amazon Bedrock + Claude: Interprets RAN KPIs, detects anomalies, and recommends optimizations.
Brings human-like reasoning to telecom decision-making.

2. Digital Twin Simulation
Safely tests suggested KPI changes before applying to real networks.
Enables impact assessment and validation.

3. Cloud-Native & API
AWS + Boto3: Cloud-hosted LLMs and orchestration.
FastAPI: Generates realistic KPI datasets on-demand for simulation.
