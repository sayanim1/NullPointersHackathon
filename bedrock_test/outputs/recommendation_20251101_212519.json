  "raw_text": "After analyzing the KPI data, I've identified cells showing degraded performance and propose the following adjustment:\n\n{\n  \"target_cell\": \"C004\",\n  \"parameter_to_adjust\": \"a3_hyst\",\n  \"suggested_value\": \"2\",\n  \"reason\": \"High HOF (8) and RLF (1) indicate handover issues. Increasing A3 hysteresis from 1 to 2 dB may reduce ping-pong handovers and improve stability.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nCell C004 shows the highest handover failure (HOF) rate of 8 and a radio link failure (RLF) of 1, which are concerning. Its current A3 hysteresis value is quite low at 1 dB, which may be causing unnecessary handovers. Increasing this to 2 dB should help reduce ping-pong effects and improve overall handover performance.\n\nOther observations:\n1. C001 has poor RSRQ (-9.5) and relatively high HOF (4), but its parameters seem reasonable.\n2. C003 has high HOF (5) but good RSRQ and RSRP. Its issues might be related to capacity or neighbor cell relations.\n3. C005 has moderate HOF (5) and RLF (2), but its A3 hysteresis is already high at 4 dB.\n\nThe suggested adjustment for C004 is the most pressing and likely to yield immediate improvements in handover performance."
