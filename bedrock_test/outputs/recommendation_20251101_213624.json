  "raw_text": "Based on the provided KPI data, I've analyzed the cells and identified the following cell showing degraded performance that requires optimization:\n\n{\n  \"target_cell\": \"C001\",\n  \"parameter_to_adjust\": \"a3_hyst\",\n  \"suggested_value\": \"2\",\n  \"reason\": \"High HOF/RLF, low RSRQ, and high A3 hysteresis. Reducing A3 hysteresis may improve handover performance and signal quality.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nCell C001 shows poor performance indicators:\n1. Low RSRQ (-19.5 dB)\n2. High combined HOF (3) and RLF (2) count\n3. Relatively high A3 hysteresis (4 dB)\n4. Low handover success rate (80.68%)\n\nReducing the A3 hysteresis from 4 dB to 2 dB should make handovers easier to trigger, potentially improving the handover success rate and reducing HOF/RLF occurrences. This adjustment may also help improve the overall signal quality (RSRQ) by allowing UEs to connect to stronger neighboring cells more readily.\n\nOther cells in the dataset don't show as significant degradation in performance, though ongoing monitoring and fine-tuning of parameters for all cells is recommended for optimal network performance."
