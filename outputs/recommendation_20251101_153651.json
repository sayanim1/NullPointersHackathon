  "raw_text": "Based on the provided KPI data, cell C002 shows degraded performance with higher handover failures (HOF) and radio link failures (RLF) compared to the other cells, as well as a lower RSRQ value. To address this, I suggest adjusting the Time-To-Trigger (TTT) parameter for this cell.\n\nHere's the proposed adjustment in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"target_cell\": \"C002\",\n  \"parameter_to_adjust\": \"ttt\",\n  \"suggested_value\": 320,\n  \"reason\": \"Reduce TTT to mitigate high HOF/RLF and improve handover performance in a highly loaded cell with poor RSRQ\"\n}\n\nThis adjustment aims to reduce the handover delay, which should help decrease the number of handover failures and radio link failures in the highly loaded cell C002. Lowering the TTT from 480ms to 320ms will make the handover process more responsive to changing radio conditions, potentially improving overall performance and user experience."
